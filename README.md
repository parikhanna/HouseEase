## An application for UBC students to find housing and roommates with ease!

 ### üìå PROJECT OVERVIEW:

 **HOUSE-EASE** is an application designed to streamline the housing search process for UBC students. It centralizes the currently fragmented student sublet and rental market by providing a single platform where students can both find and list sublets. Additionally, nearby residents with available rental properties can also list them on the platform. This unified approach makes it easier for students to find housing that meets their needs, all in one place, simplifying what is often a complex and scattered process. 

### üôéüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è TARGET AUDIENCE:

- Students and homeowners near UBC who wish to list their available housing.
- UBC students transitioning from their first year in residence to subsequent years and looking for suitable housing.

### üí° MOTIVATION FOR THE PROJECT:

This project is inspired by my own challenges and those of my friends in finding suitable housing at UBC. It aims to simplify the housing search process for students, making it less daunting and more efficient.

## PHASE 4 - TASK 3:

Upon reviewing the UML diagram, I recognized that the `RentalListingApp` class does not require a direct connection to the `Consumer` class. Currently, the sole purpose of this association is to facilitate access and modifications to the favorites list managed by the `Consumer`. Given that our application does not yet support user accounts or the saving of user-specific data, the `Consumer` class becomes somewhat redundant. Its primary function is merely to manage the favorites list. While separating it into its own class enhances cohesion and adheres to the single responsibility principle, it also complicates our architecture unnecessarily at this stage.

A potential refactoring could involve eliminating the `Consumer` class and integrating the favorites list directly within the `RentalListings` class. This would simplify the application's structure by removing unnecessary associations and make the system more straightforward and less coupled. However, this approach does have a trade-off: if we plan to extend the application's functionality to include user-specific features, reintroducing the `Consumer` class would become essential to manage individual user data effectively.
