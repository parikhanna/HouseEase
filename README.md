## An application for UBC students to find housing and roommates with ease!

 ### 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW:

 **HOUSE-EASE** is an application designed to streamline the housing search process for UBC students. It centralizes the currently fragmented student sublet and rental market by providing a single platform where students can both find and list sublets. Additionally, nearby residents with available rental properties can also list them on the platform. This unified approach makes it easier for students to find housing that meets their needs, all in one place, simplifying what is often a complex and scattered process. 

### 🙎🏻‍♀️ TARGET AUDIENCE:

- Students and homeowners near UBC who wish to list their available housing.
- UBC students transitioning from their first year in residence to subsequent years and looking for suitable housing.

### 💡 MOTIVATION FOR THE PROJECT:

This project is inspired by my own challenges and those of my friends in finding suitable housing at UBC. It aims to simplify the housing search process for students, making it less daunting and more efficient.
